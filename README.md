# PBO Explorer
Simple WPF tool to see content of a pbo file

It allows you to quickly check if packaging and macros have worked the expected way.

It also allows you to walkthrough Arma or mods PBO to check for configuration and files.
In that case, please check the licensing of files to ensure you are allowed to extract any data.
